    /// - Based on swkotor2.exe AssignCommand/DelayCommand system
    /// - Located via string references: "DelayCommand" @ 0x007be900 (delay command script field), "Commandable" @ 0x007bec3c (commandable flag)
    /// - "deleted %d trace commands" @ 0x007b95d4 (command cleanup debug message)
    /// - Original implementation: Executes a stored action/script command on entity
    /// - Used by AssignCommand NWScript function (execute action on different entity immediately)
    /// - Used by DelayCommand NWScript function (execute action after specified delay)
    /// - STORE_STATE opcode in NCS VM stores stack/local state (stack pointer, local variables) for DelayCommand closure semantics
    /// - Action execution: Command executes immediately when action runs (no delay in ActionDoCommand itself - delay handled by DelayScheduler)
    /// - DelayCommand flow: DelayScheduler queues ActionDoCommand for execution after delay, preserves execution context (stack/locals)
    /// - AssignCommand flow: ActionDoCommand added to target entity's action queue, executes immediately
    /// - Command storage: Command stored as action delegate/closure, captures execution context (caller, variables, stack state)
    /// - Error handling: Command execution errors are caught and logged, action marked as Failed
    /// - Based on NWScript function implementations: AssignCommand (routine ID varies by game), DelayCommand (routine ID varies by game)
