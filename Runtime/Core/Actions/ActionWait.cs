    /// - Based on swkotor2.exe ActionWait NWScript function
    /// - Located via string references: "ActionWait" @ 0x007be8e4, "Wait" action type
    /// - Action timing: Uses game simulation time (ITimeManager) for duration tracking
    /// - Original implementation: Entity waits (does nothing) for specified duration
    /// - Used for scripted delays, timing sequences, animation synchronization
    /// - Action completes after duration expires, allowing next action in queue to execute
    /// - Duration measured in game seconds (not real-time), respects game time scale/pause
