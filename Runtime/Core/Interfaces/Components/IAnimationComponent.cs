    /// Animation Component Interface:
    /// - Based on swkotor2.exe animation system
    /// - Located via string references: "Animation" @ 0x007c3440, "AnimList" @ 0x007c3694
    /// - "PlayAnim" @ 0x007c346c, "AnimLoop" @ 0x007c4c70 (animation loop flag)
    /// - "CurrentAnim" @ 0x007c38d4, "NextAnim" @ 0x007c38c8 (animation state tracking)
    /// - Animation timing: "frameStart" @ 0x007ba698, "frameEnd" @ 0x007ba668 (animation frame timing)
    /// - Original implementation: Entities with models can play animations from MDL animation arrays
    /// - Animation IDs reference animation indices in MDL animation arrays (0-based index)
    /// - CurrentAnimation: Currently playing animation ID (-1 = no animation, idle state)
    /// - AnimationSpeed: Playback rate multiplier (1.0 = normal, 2.0 = double speed, 0.5 = half speed)
    /// - IsLooping: Whether current animation should loop (true = loop, false = play once)
    /// - AnimationTime: Current time position in animation (0.0 to animation duration)
    /// - AnimationComplete: True when non-looping animation has finished playing
    /// - Animations loaded from MDX files (animation keyframe data), referenced by MDL model files
    /// - Animation system updates animation time each frame, triggers completion events
