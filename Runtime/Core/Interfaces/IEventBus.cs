    /// Event Bus Interface:
    /// - Based on swkotor2.exe script event system
    /// - Located via string references: Script event constants (EVENT_ON_*, CSWSSCRIPTEVENT_EVENTTYPE_*)
    /// - Subscribe/Unsubscribe: Register/unregister event handlers for specific event types
    /// - Publish: Immediately dispatches event to all subscribers (synchronous)
    /// - QueueEvent: Queues event for deferred dispatch at frame boundary (prevents re-entrancy issues)
    /// - DispatchQueuedEvents: Processes all queued events (called at frame boundary)
    /// - FireScriptEvent: Fires script event on entity (triggers script hooks like OnHeartbeat, OnAttacked, etc.)
    /// - Script events: Heartbeat, OnNotice, Attacked, Damaged, Death, Dialogue, etc.
    /// - Event system decouples components and allows script-driven behavior
    /// - Event routing: FUN_004dcfb0 @ 0x004dcfb0 routes script events to entity handlers (case 0xa = OnDeath, case 0x1 = OnHeartbeat, etc.)
