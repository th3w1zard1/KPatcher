    /// - Based on swkotor2.exe walkmesh/navigation system
    /// - Located via string references: "BWM V1.0" @ 0x007c061c (BWM format signature), "BWM" (walkmesh format), walkmesh-related functions
    /// - BWM format: Binary walkmesh format (WOK = area walkmesh, PWK = placeable walkmesh, DWK = door walkmesh)
    /// - FindPath: A* pathfinding algorithm from start to goal position
    /// - FindFaceAt: Finds walkmesh face index containing given position
    /// - GetFaceCenter: Returns center point of walkmesh face
    /// - GetAdjacentFaces: Returns neighboring faces for pathfinding traversal
    /// - IsWalkable: Checks if face is walkable (based on surface material lookup in surfacemat.2da)
    /// - GetSurfaceMaterial: Returns surface material index (used for sound effects, walkability)
    /// - Raycast: Line intersection test against walkmesh
    /// - TestLineOfSight: Determines if line between two points is unobstructed
    /// - ProjectToSurface: Projects point onto walkmesh surface (for height correction)
    /// - Walkmesh projection: FUN_004f5070 @ 0x004f5070 projects positions to walkmesh surface after movement
