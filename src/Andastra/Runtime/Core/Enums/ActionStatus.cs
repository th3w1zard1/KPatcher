    /// - Based on swkotor2.exe action execution system
    /// - Actions return status after Update() call: InProgress (continue), Complete (done), Failed (abort)
    /// - Action queue processes actions sequentially: current action updates until Complete or Failed
    /// - InProgress: Action continues execution (called again next frame)
    /// - Complete: Action finished successfully, next action dequeued
    /// - Failed: Action failed (e.g., pathfinding failed, target invalid), next action dequeued
    /// - Action execution: FUN_00508260 @ 0x00508260 loads actions from GFF, FUN_00505bc0 @ 0x00505bc0 saves actions to GFF
    /// - Action queue processing: Actions updated each frame until status changes from InProgress
    /// </remarks>
