    /// Sound Player Interface:
    /// - Based on swkotor2.exe sound playback system
    /// - Located via string references: "PlaySound" @ 0x007c5f70, "Sound" @ 0x007bc558 (sound entity type)
    /// - "Sound List" @ 0x007bd290 (sound entity list in area), "AmbientSound" @ 0x007c0e98 (ambient sound field)
    /// - "SoundVolume" @ 0x007c0eb0 (sound volume), "SoundDistance" @ 0x007c0ec8 (sound distance/range)
    /// - Original implementation: KOTOR plays WAV files for sound effects (ambient, combat, UI, etc.)
    /// - Sound files: Stored as WAV resources, referenced by ResRef (e.g., "sound01.wav")
    /// - Positional audio: Sounds can be played at entity positions (3D spatial audio with distance attenuation)
    /// - Playback control: Play, Stop, volume, pan, pitch
    /// - Sound types: Ambient (area background), combat (weapon hits), UI (button clicks), voice-over (dialogue), music (BGM)
    /// - Original engine: DirectSound/DirectSound3D for 3D spatial audio, WAV file format support
