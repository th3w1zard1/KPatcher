    /// Jump To Object Action:
    /// - Based on swkotor2.exe ActionJumpToObject NWScript function
    /// - Located via string references: "JumpToObject" action type (ACTION_TYPE_JUMP_TO_OBJECT constant), "Position" @ 0x007bef70 (position field)
    /// - Original implementation: Instantly teleports entity to target object's position and facing without movement animation
    /// - Used for scripted movement (cutscenes, scripted sequences), following behavior, teleportation effects
    /// - Position and facing copied directly from target - bypasses pathfinding, walkmesh validation, and movement interpolation
    /// - Target validation: Checks if target entity exists and is valid (IsValid flag), action fails if target is null/invalid
    /// - No validation: Jump does not check if destination is valid (can teleport outside walkmesh, into walls, etc.)
    /// - Animation: No movement animation plays (entity appears at target's location instantly)
    /// - Action completes immediately after position is set (single frame execution if target is valid)
    /// - Usage: Cutscenes, scripted sequences, teleportation spells/effects, following behavior initialization
    /// - Contrast with ActionMoveToObject: MoveToObject uses pathfinding and movement animation, JumpToObject is instant teleport
    /// - Based on NWScript function ActionJumpToObject (routine ID varies by game version)
