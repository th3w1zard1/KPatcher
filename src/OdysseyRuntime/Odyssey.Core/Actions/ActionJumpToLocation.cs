    /// Jump To Location Action:
    /// - Based on swkotor2.exe ActionJumpToLocation NWScript function
    /// - Located via string references: "JumpToLocation" action type (ACTION_TYPE_JUMP_TO_LOCATION constant), "Position" @ 0x007bef70 (position field)
    /// - Original implementation: Instantly teleports entity to specified location and facing without movement animation
    /// - Used for scripted movement (cutscenes, scripted sequences), area transitions, teleportation effects
    /// - Teleportation: Position and facing set immediately - bypasses pathfinding, walkmesh validation, and movement interpolation
    /// - Area transitions: Can jump between areas if location specifies different area (requires area transition system handling)
    /// - No validation: Jump does not check if destination is valid (can teleport outside walkmesh, into walls, etc.)
    /// - Animation: No movement animation plays (entity appears at new location instantly)
    /// - Action completes immediately after position is set (single frame execution)
    /// - Usage: Cutscenes, scripted sequences, area loading positioning, teleportation spells/effects
    /// - Contrast with ActionMoveToLocation: MoveToLocation uses pathfinding and movement animation, JumpToLocation is instant teleport
    /// - Based on NWScript function ActionJumpToLocation (routine ID varies by game version)
