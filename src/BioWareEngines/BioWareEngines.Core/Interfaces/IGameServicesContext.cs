    /// - Based on swkotor2.exe script execution context system
    /// - Located via string references: Script execution context provides access to game systems
    /// - Original implementation: NWScript execution context (IExecutionContext) provides access to game services
    /// - Services accessible from scripts: DialogueManager, PlayerEntity, CombatManager, PartyManager, ModuleLoader
    /// - FactionManager: Manages faction relationships and hostility (repute.2da lookup)
    /// - PerceptionManager: Handles creature perception (sight/hearing, OnPerception events)
    /// - CameraController: Controls camera positioning and movement (dialogue cameras, cutscenes)
    /// - SoundPlayer: Plays sound effects and ambient audio (positional audio, volume control)
    /// - GameSession: Manages game state (current module, save/load, player progression)
    /// - IsLoadingFromSave: Flag indicating if game is loading from save file (prevents script execution during load)
    /// - Based on swkotor2.exe: FUN_005226d0 @ 0x005226d0 (script execution context setup)
